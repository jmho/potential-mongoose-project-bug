# Potential Mongoose Project Bug

Repo investigating mongoose's strange behavior when it comes to imported modules. I could be absolutely silly or missing something, but I wanted to create this repo to document my personal issues.

## Getting Started

1. In `./database` run `npm i` to install all the dependencies. 
2. Run `npm run build` to compile the module.
3. In `./server` run `npm i` to install all the dependencies + our database module. 
4. Run `npm start` to start our mock server. The server should print the following on completion.
